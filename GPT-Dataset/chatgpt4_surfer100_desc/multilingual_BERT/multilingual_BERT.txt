SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
Multilingual BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a variant of the BERT model designed in the field of natural language processing. It's able to understand and generate language based on the context of the words in a sentence. Part of the appeal of Multilingual BERT is its ability to handle multiple languages, significantly expanding the scope and accessibility of applications. The concept is grounded in the push towards more inclusive and globalized AI technology, as well as in the aspiration to build more sophisticated, context-aware systems.

SECTION 2: HISTORY
The BERT model, including its multilingual variant, was introduced by researchers at Google in 2018. It is an evolution of the original transformer model. These models were created to address limitations in understanding the context of language, with the traditional methods often misunderstanding words with multiple meanings. BERT and Multilingual BERT were introduced to tackle this issue by introducing bidirectional context. 

SECTION 3: KEY IDEAS
The crucial innovation of Multilingual BERT lies in its bidirectional nature. This model analyses text from both left to right and right to left, thereby understanding the full context of each word. In addition, this model is trained on a large corpus of text from the internet in multiple languages. This is crucial to its ability to generate responses in, and translate between, different languages. It also uses a Masked Language Model, which randomly masks some of the input tokens, encouraging the model to understand the context instead of relying on specific words.

SECTION 4: USES/APPLICATIONS
Multilingual BERT is utilized in a wide swath of applications, mostly in fields that require language comprehension and generation. This includes machine translation, information extraction, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis among others. Its multilingual capabilities make it a significant driver of inclusivity and global reach in many AI-powered systems.

SECTION 5: VARIATIONS
There are several variations and successors of the BERT model, such as RoBERTa, GPT-2, and T5, that offer different strengths and capabilities. Some are even more powerful and resource-efficient. Multilingual BERT, however, retains its unique role in that it is trained on multiple languages, making it a crucial part of the landscape in Natural Language Processing applications and its evolution towards global inclusivity.
