Section 1: Introduction
Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop) optimizer is a popular optimizer in the field of machine learning, particularly in deep learning subfield. Developed to resolve the diminishing learning rates issue in gradient descent, RMSprop adapts the learning rate for each of the weights in the model. It avoids aggressive and suboptimal steps during convergence, making it suitable for non-stationary objectives and large-scale neural networks. The motivation behind RMSprop lies in overcoming the limitations of traditional gradient descent and facilitating more effective learning.

Section 2: History
RMSprop was introduced by Geoff Hinton in his Coursera Machine Learning course. It was proposed to improve upon the limitations of the AdaGrad algorithm, which suffered from progressively slower learning rates in long-running tasks. RMSprop aimed to address this issue, providing a more practical and robust way for optimizer to adjust learning rates for complex, large-scale tasks.

Section 3: Key Ideas
RMSprop treats the learning rate as a hyperparameter and uses a moving average of the squared gradient to normalize the gradient itself. In essence, it keeps a moving average of the squared gradient for each weight, and divides the gradient by the square root of this mean. This allows for an element-wise learning rate, providing an adaptive method for assigning learning rates to individual parameters, thereby effectively addressing the challenges of scaled gradients.

Section 4: Uses/Applications
RMSprop is applied in various machine learning tasks involving large-scale neural networks. This includes object detection, natural language processing, image and speech recognition, and many other areas that require neural networks. Itâ€™s particularly beneficial when dealing with non-convex optimization problems or complex, multi-layer architectures.

Section 5: Variations
Several variations and similar models to RMSprop exist, including Adam, AdaGrad, and SGD with momentum. These optimizers share RMSprop's central ideas of adaptive learning rates but apply different approaches. Adam, like RMSprop, maintains an exponentially decaying average of past gradients, but also includes an element of momentum by keeping an exponentially decaying average of past updates. How RMSprop fits into the larger picture of machine learning is its focus on maintaining distinct learning rates for different parameters, a feature now widely adopted across various optimization algorithms.
