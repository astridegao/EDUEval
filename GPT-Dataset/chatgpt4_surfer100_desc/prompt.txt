Generate a survey about TOPIC, there should be five sub-sections: Introduction, History, Key Ideas, Variations and Applications. Each sub-section should contain 50-150 words. The following is the guideline for each section:

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
Describe what the topic is (a method, a model, a task, a dataset), which field/subfield it is part of, quick overview of applications and motivation behind concept and related ideas).


SECTION 2: HISTORY
Describe when or by who the topic was introduced, in what context, what problems it addresses.


SECTION 3: KEY IDEAS
Describe in greater depth (could provide some mathematical context or explain core concepts).


SECTION 4: USES/APPLICATIONS
Describe for what tasks this model/data is used.


SECTION 5: VARIATIONS
