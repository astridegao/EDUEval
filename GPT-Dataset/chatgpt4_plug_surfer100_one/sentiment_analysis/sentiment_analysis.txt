Section 1: Introduction
Sentiment Analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a sub-field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves determining the emotional tone behind words to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed within an online mention. It is used to analyze viewpoints in text data using computational methods.

Section 2: History
The concept of sentiment analysis began to gain traction with the rise of online social platforms and user-generated content in the early 2000s. The increasing volume of online data in the form of blogs, reviews, and social media posts created a need for automated methods of understanding human sentiment and emotion in text.

Section 3: Key Ideas
The key idea behind sentiment analysis is the use of NLP, text analysis, and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information from source materials. Sentiment analysis can be binary (positive/negative), multi-class (positive/negative/neutral), or even more complex, identifying a range of emotions or opinions.

Section 4: Variations
There are several types of sentiment analysis, including fine-grained (very positive to very negative), emotion detection (happy, sad, angry, etc.), aspect-based (what specific aspects or features people are mentioning in a positive or negative light), and intent analysis (e.g., interested, not interested). Each type has its own use cases and can be applied to different types of text data.

Section 5: Applications
Sentiment analysis has a wide range of applications. It's used in social media monitoring, brand monitoring, customer service, and market research to understand customer sentiment towards products, brands, or services in online conversations. It's also used in politics to understand public opinion, in finance to predict stock market movement, and in many other fields where public opinion is important.
