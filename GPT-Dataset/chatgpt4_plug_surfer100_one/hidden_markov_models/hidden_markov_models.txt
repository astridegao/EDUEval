Section 1: Introduction
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a type of statistical model that allow us to predict a sequence of unknown (hidden) variables from a set of observed variables. A key feature of HMMs is the assumption of the Markov property, which states that the probability of each subsequent state depends only on what was the previous state.

Section 2: History
The concept of Markov Chains was proposed by Andrey Markov in the early 20th century, and the extension to Hidden Markov Models was developed in the mid-20th century. HMMs gained popularity in the 1980s with the advent of algorithms like the Baum-Welch Algorithm for efficient computation.

Section 3: Key Ideas
The key idea behind HMMs is that they model a system that is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved states. HMMs consist of two key components: the underlying hidden states and the observable outputs. Each state has a probability distribution over the possible output tokens, and transitions between states are governed by transition probabilities.

Section 4: Variations
There are several variations of HMMs, including continuous and discrete HMMs, depending on whether the hidden states and observations are continuous or discrete. Other variations include tied-mixture HMMs and factorial HMMs, which allow for more complex relationships between hidden states and observations.

Section 5: Applications
HMMs have a wide range of applications, particularly in areas where we need to infer the hidden states of a system over time from observable data. They are used in speech recognition systems to model the speech signal and its variations over time, in natural language processing for part-of-speech tagging, in bioinformatics for protein or gene prediction, and in robotics for the estimation of the state of a system over time.
