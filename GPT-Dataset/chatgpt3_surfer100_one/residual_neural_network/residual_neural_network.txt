<INTRODUCTION>
Residual Neural Network (ResNet) is a deep learning architecture that gained popularity for its ability to train very deep neural networks. Introduced by Kaiming He et al. in 2015, ResNet addresses the vanishing gradient problem that occurs when training deep networks. It achieves this by using skip connections or shortcuts that allow the gradient to flow directly from one layer to another without passing through a series of non-linear activation layers. This helps in avoiding the degradation problem, where deeper networks start to perform worse as they become harder to optimize.

<HISTORY>
The concept of skipping connections in neural networks was not new, but ResNet provided a systematic way of implementing it. Prior to ResNet, researchers observed that as the depth of networks increased, they started encountering diminishing returns in performance. ResNet used the idea of residual learning, where the network learns to model the residuals or the difference between the actual output and the desired output. By learning these residuals, the network can focus on refining the learned features rather than starting from scratch at each layer, resulting in improved performance.

<KEY IDEAS>
The key idea behind ResNet is the use of residual blocks, which consist of skip connections that bypass one or more layers. These skip connections create shortcuts for the gradient flow, allowing information to be preserved and preventing the vanishing gradient problem. The residual blocks are stacked to form a deep network architecture with hundreds or even thousands of layers. Another important concept in ResNet is the use of batch normalization, which helps in stabilizing the learning process and accelerating convergence. Overall, ResNet enables the training of very deep networks and has shown impressive performance in various computer vision tasks.

<VARIATIONS>
Since the introduction of ResNet, several variations and extensions have been proposed to enhance its performance. One such variation is the ResNeXt architecture, which introduces a cardinality parameter to capture different feature groupings within a layer. This leads to increased representational power and better performance. DenseNet is another notable architecture inspired by ResNet, where each layer is connected to every other layer in a dense manner. This allows for more efficient information flow and alleviates the vanishing gradient problem to a great extent.

<APPLICATIONS>
ResNet has proven to be highly effective in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. In image classification, ResNet has achieved state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets like ImageNet. The ability of ResNet to train very deep networks has also been beneficial in tasks like face recognition and text recognition. Beyond computer vision, ResNet has been successfully applied to other domains such as natural language processing and speech recognition, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness.
